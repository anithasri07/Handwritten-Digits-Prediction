# MNIST Digit Classification

This project is a simple neural network built using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 🔍 Overview
- Used TensorFlow/Keras to build a Sequential model
- Performed EDA on the MNIST dataset
- Applied a neural network with one hidden layer and a softmax output
- Achieved ~98% accuracy on test data

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Inbuilt Dataset
- Shape: 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- Each image: 28x28 grayscale pixel matrix

## 📌 Steps Covered
- Data exploration (EDA)
- Data normalization
- Model building with `Sequential()`
- Training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix and visualizations

## 🧠 Technologies Used
